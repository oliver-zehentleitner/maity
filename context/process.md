# Process

How Maity itself is built: the rules its own agents and maintainer work
by, where they differ from what the product prescribes.

## Pull requests get an independent first review on a different vendor's model; the coordinator decides, disagreements go to the maintainer

**Id:** 0b12c29d-1539-4737-9bc3-e5e5815238ec
**Type:** decision
**Status:** active
**Evidence:** confirmed
**Source:** the maintainer's statements, 2026-10-22, relayed by the coordinator
**Revisit when:** the first-pass reviewer and the coordinator disagree often enough that the maintainer becomes the bottleneck, or the review cost becomes binding again
**See:** incidents.md#multi-agent-review-runs-exhausted-the-maintainers-monthly-budget — 1a5e729f-816a-4682-ab8c-a2029aa1ea0a — as of 2026-10-22

A reviewer running on ChatGPT does the first pass on a pull request and
reports to the coordinator (the admin agent). The coordinator verifies
its findings in the code before posting them and decides; where the two
disagree, the question goes to the maintainer with both positions
written out. This extends the earlier process rather than replacing it:
where security is at stake (the runner, the hub's security slices) the
coordinator still runs its own adversarial reviews.

**Reason:** the maintainer wants the first pass to relieve the
coordinator and to question it again from another angle — a reviewer on
another vendor's model does not share the coordinator's view of the code.

**Rejected alternative:** a further admin or proxy agent between the
maintainer and the team, considered by the coordinator. Rejected because
communication was not the bottleneck, and every relay loses detail.

## Dogfooding: maity.team is the only platform for building Maity

**Id:** 9d07bc5d-a65e-46d9-809f-c80353be6319
**Type:** decision
**Status:** active
**Evidence:** confirmed
**Source:** the maintainer's statement, 2026-10-22
**Revisit when:** work on Maity needs something the hub cannot carry yet, or maity.team is down for longer than the work can wait

From 2026-10-22, the work on Maity runs through maity.team only: cards,
claims, questions to the maintainer, messages between agents and
reports. New agents join there with a join line; the maintainer talks to
them there.

**Reason:** the maintainer's: use the product to find its gaps. Dogfooding
had already found defects the fixtures hid — the install line, cards
whose result is not code, the pointer block written into a tracked file.

**Alternatives:** unknown.

## Reviewer independence assumes separate environments; two identities in one workspace mixed up credentials

**Type:** constraint
**Type:** incident
**Status:** active
**Evidence:** confirmed
**Source:** the coordinator's observation, 2026-10-22

Two agent identities working in one shared Codex workspace once mixed up
their credentials. An independent review only counts as independent when the reviewer runs
in an environment of its own, with its own clone and its own state
directory, so each identity stays separate from the agents it reviews.

**Reason:** a reviewer sharing an environment with the agents it reviews
can act under, or read as, another identity, which undoes the point of a
second pair of eyes. Whether and how the hub tracks an agent's
environment is decided: the hub warns, not refuses, when environments are
shared; the coordinator acts on the warning (re-confirmed by the
coordinator, 2026-10-22).

**Alternatives:** unknown.

## Changelog entries are one file per pull request in changelog.d/, folded into CHANGELOG.md at release

**Id:** b1258d90-a82b-48a1-9c5f-7ee4eb1295f9
**Type:** decision
**Status:** active
**Evidence:** confirmed
**Source:** the maintainer's decision, 2026-10-22, via the inbox
**Revisit when:** GitHub runs checks on pull requests with merge conflicts, or the team shrinks to one pull request open at a time

A pull request adds its changelog entry as a new file in `changelog.d/`
and never edits `CHANGELOG.md`; `tools/changelog.py release` folds the
files into a version section of `CHANGELOG.md` (Keep a Changelog format
unchanged) and deletes them. CI validates the files. The format is in
`changelog.d/README.md`.

**Reason:** every pull request added lines under `[Unreleased]` in the one
file, so each merge put nearly every other open pull request into
conflict, and GitHub runs no CI on a pull request with conflicts — agents
spent rounds rebasing only to get their checks to run. Separate files
cannot conflict.

**Rejected alternative:** `merge=union` for `CHANGELOG.md` in
`.gitattributes`. Not relied on: whether GitHub's server-side merge and
its conflict check honour merge attributes could not be confirmed (the
reports found say it did not), and a union merge would place
concurrent lines without regard to the headings they belong under.

**Rejected alternative:** keeping the single file and rebasing on every
merge — the status quo that caused the problem.

## Overnight, the coordinator deploys maity.team without a per-deploy go once main is green

**Id:** 3ac98e12-f84b-423d-98de-3d3f7f610b8f
**Type:** decision
**Status:** active
**Evidence:** confirmed
**Source:** the maintainer's standing instruction, 2026-10-22, relayed by the coordinator
**Revisit when:** the maintainer withdraws the standing instruction, or a deploy without a go breaks maity.team
**See:** https://github.com/oliver-zehentleitner/maity — 5e42eb26-9883-49e2-89c0-9fe4e6517c62 — as of 2026-10-22

For the night of 2026-10-22 the maintainer gave a standing instruction:
the coordinator deploys a new image to maity.team before the maintainer
is back, once `main` is green after the merges, with no go per deploy.
The rollout follows one sequence: the image from the publish workflow on
`main`, its digest pinned in the Helm values, a database dump from the
backup job first, `helm upgrade --wait`, migrations on start, then
`/api/v1/health` checked for the schema head and the dashboard opened.
The few seconds of 503 during the rollout are expected and accepted, not
an incident: the hub runs as one pod replaced with `Recreate`, for the
reasons in the hub's Kubernetes entry.

**Reason:** the maintainer's instruction; no reason beyond having the
night's merges deployed before the maintainer is back was stated.

**Alternatives:** none were weighed.

## When a reviewer returns, the cover's finished reviews stand and the returning reviewer takes the unstarted ones

**Id:** 8ba32bfa-41ff-4351-8884-4ac5ee08bae5
**Type:** decision
**Type:** incident
**Status:** active
**Evidence:** confirmed
**Source:** the coordinator's rule, 2026-10-22, set when the reviewer came back from a usage limit
**Revisit when:** a second reviewer joins, or reviews are reassigned in a way the board can show without a list from the coordinator
**See:** process.md#pull-requests-get-an-independent-first-review-on-a-different-vendors-model-the-coordinator-decides-disagreements-go-to-the-maintainer — 0b12c29d-1539-4737-9bc3-e5e5815238ec — as of 2026-10-22

While the reviewer was stopped by a usage limit, the coordinator covered
its reviews. When the reviewer came back it asked for an exact split, so
that nothing would be reviewed twice. The rule: reviews the cover has
finished stand; every review not yet started goes to the returning
reviewer, in the order the coordinator gives, and the reviewer claims
each card before starting it.

**Reason:** the split keeps finished work and gives the review load back
to the reviewer.

**Rejected alternatives:**
- Everything back to the returning reviewer: the cover's finished
  reviews would be done again.
- The cover keeps everything it was covering: the coordinator is the
  cover, and would stay the bottleneck for reviews.

**Incident:** about two hours later the coordinator started reviews of
its own on pull requests it had already handed back, and stopped them
when it noticed. Learned: check the handback list before assigning a
review.
