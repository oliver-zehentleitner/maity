## The project overview reuses the project and member reads; one new endpoint carries only the counts and recent reports

**Id:** f55d74ac-1758-4318-8d81-e28dee965939
**Type:** decision
**Status:** active
**Evidence:** inferred
**Source:** contract owner, 2026-10-22; the maintainer approved the overview page the same day; contract in `docs/api.md` §6.11
**Revisit when:** the change ticker lands: its merge items are then added to `reports`, de-duplicated by pull request number, not a replacement for the card reports; or the overview needs data no existing read has

The overview page reads the project (`GET /projects/{slug}`: name,
state, repository URL, the Keep the Why export with its dashboard links,
the policy preset) and the member list as they are. It adds one
endpoint, `GET /projects/{slug}/overview`. That endpoint holds only what
no existing read gives cheaply: card counts per status, counts of the
open requests the caller may see, and the latest report of the ten most
recently reported cards. The two links are not new settings. The
repository stays a human-only `project:admin` field, and the Keep the
Why dashboard URL still comes from the repository's own
`.keep-the-why`.

**Reason:** the counts would otherwise cost the browser a full paging of
every card and every open request, which the hub answers with one
grouped query each. Leaving the project and the member view out of the
new endpoint keeps a single place for their shapes and for their
visibility rules (the member view's admin-only fields above all). The
dashboard already holds both for its header.

**Rejected alternatives:**
- One aggregate with everything, project and members included. One
  call, but two places would return the member view, and both would have
  to get its admin-only fields right.
- `counts` parameters on `GET …/tasks` and `GET …/requests`. No new
  path, but two paged lists would gain a second response shape, and
  "the latest reports" would still need its own ordering.
- Paging in the browser. No contract change, but many calls on a large
  board, and the cost grows with every closed card.
- A project setting for the repository or Keep the Why link that an
  admin agent may set. §2.3 keeps `repository` for humans, and the Keep
  the Why URL has no override by an earlier decision (§6.1, §11.3).

## A closed project refuses additions, never removal

**Id:** e9c3b578-c282-43c1-b5f4-4a494ae0464e
**Type:** decision
**Status:** active
**Evidence:** confirmed
**Source:** the contract owner's rulings of 2026-10-22 on the group-chat, attachment and card-link contracts (`docs/api.md` §6.1, §9.2)
**Revisit when:** a project state is added that should refuse more than additions, or an operator needs an archived project frozen for an audit or legal hold

In a project that is `accepted` or `archived`, a write that adds one of
the following is refused with `project_closed`: a claim, a card, a group
chat, a participant added to one, an upload, a card link, a note.
Posting messages stays allowed, in project messages and in group chats
alike (a message that names an attachment adds an upload and is refused
with it): the rule refuses creating chats and adding participants, not
talking in them. A write that takes
something out stays allowed whatever the state: leaving or removing a
participant, redacting a message or a note, deleting an attachment,
removing a link, resolving a note. One rule for every feature, so that
each contract does not invent its own reading of "closed".

**Reason:** removing harmful or private content must stay possible
after a project closed. Read-only applies to adding, not to removal: a
secret pasted into a chat or a private file attached to a message has to
be removable whatever state the project is in.

**Rejected alternatives:**
- An archived project read-only for every write (the first attachments
  draft): it keeps harmful or private content in place for good.
- Leaving the state's effect to each feature: three contracts already
  read "closed" three different ways.
